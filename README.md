A friend of mine recently introduced me to a browser game that takes inspiration
from the classic game 2048. As a challenge to myself, i decided to write a 
command line app to simulate the game and also suggest a best-strategy in 
order to teach myself C. This is mostly a fun little side project intended
to familiarize myself with the C programming language, as my Low-Level 
Programming class is 100% C-based and I had no experience with the 
language prior. Wish me luck!
